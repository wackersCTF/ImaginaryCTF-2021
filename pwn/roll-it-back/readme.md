# Roll it back

## Solution
The problem with this challenge is that I'm writing this writeup way after the ctf ended so I don't have access to the description of the challenge. However, I do have my attempt at understanding the code.

Apparently, this challenge was an LFSR or Linear-feedback shift register, according to a challenge writer on the ImaginaryCTF discord.
