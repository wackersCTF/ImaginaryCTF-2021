# Imaginary
Whatâ€™s ImaginaryCTF without good old sqrt(-1)?

## Solution (by wyl3waK)
This challenge is simply a test of how good your coding skills are. Logically, it isn't very hard, though this isn't really a beginner-type problem either.

wyl3waK is the one who solved this challenge during the ctf. I procrastinated somewhat in setting up some python modules, but I got an untested script is attached. I originally tried to solve this with json and telnet but that didn't work out. The file named ```imaginary.py``` is the original source code provided in the ctf.
